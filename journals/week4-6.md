WEEK 4

- first time writing API calls, surprisingly intuitive + i was already familiar
with the requests library through django so managed easily
- first time using command-line args, found debugging annoying because i had
to change the launch.json for every individual test i wanted to do instead of
just being able to run and use breakpoints

WEEK 5

- i used to use unittest just because i was more familiar with it but now that
i've seen how easy pytest is it's going to be hard going back for any reason

WEEK 6 (mostly done)

- scourgify was a lot of fun, still have to clean it up, still have to finish
shirt
- moving through course slowly/sporadically because i feel cs50 is more about 
practicing python for me than learning new things and i want to focus on 
learning java so that i won't be blind-sided when we switch over

WEEK 7 LOOK-AHEAD

- regex feels like an entirely new language
